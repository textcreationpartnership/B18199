            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <q>Moreover there are many Musical Instruments, found out in these last times, which are called Organs, the Authors where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are lost; from which (for the sweetness of tune) they deserv all admiration, and prais, much truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like those which <hi>David</hi> King of the Jews made, as we have related in the first book of this work, whereon the Levites sung Hymns, as we in like manner now use on these.

                  <q>It is easie to understand, what Musick ought to be in the Church of Christ, and in Ecclesiastical Assemblies; namely such as may have a <hi>decorum,</hi> order, and edification; for hereunto was it invented, and instituted.</q> Here is an express Analogy of faith requires it; but more plainly, They in the Old Testament, made their solemn praises with <hi>Musick Vocal, and Instrumental,</hi> for temporal deliverances, as, the bringing the children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> their passage through the red Sea, their protection in the Wilderness, their arrival in <hi>Canaan,</hi> their injoyment of Typical Ordinances, as a Levitical Priesthood.

               <p>Instrumental Musick hath been admirable, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in its effects, and consequences, wrought thereby; herein we will instance in two particulars. The expelling of evil spirits, and the regaining of good.</p>
               <p>First, the former of these, <hi>Perturbabatque Saul malus spiritus à Jehovâ,</hi> an evil spirit from the LORD troubled <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.14.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.14.</note> but in <hi>v.</hi> 23.<note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note>

               <p>Again herein is the excellency, and wonder compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in Instrumental Musick, that its efficacy consists, not only in driving away evil spirits, but in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of good: When the Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> was desired to prophesie before the three Kings of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Edom: Bring me</hi> (saith he) <hi>a Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strel; and it came to pass when the Minstrel play'd, that the hand of the Lord came upon him,</hi> 2 King. 3.15.<note place="margin">2 King. 3.15.</note> In which passage, it is very remarkable, that <hi>Elisha</hi> being sent for, upon the motion of good King <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphat</hi> (with whom upon his arrival, he found the King of <hi>Samaria</hi>) he was highly displeased, and greatly offended at <hi>Ahab;</hi> for the sacred text saith, <hi>Elisha said unto the King of</hi> Israel, <hi>What have I to do with thee? get thee to the Prophets of thy Father, and to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of thy Mother.— As the Lord of hosts liveth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of</hi> Jehoshaphat <hi>the King of</hi> Judah, <hi>I would not look towards thee, nor see thee,</hi> v. 13, 14.<note place="margin">Ver. 13, 14.</note> Here good <hi>Elisha,</hi> is too much burdened, and oppressed in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane passions, which brought upon him the spirit of

               <p n="2">II. That it is commanded in the New Testament,<note place="margin">II. That it is commanded in the New Testament.</note> is already proved, in that it is so solemnly commanded in the 33. <hi>Psalm</hi> v. 1-3. And that upon Moral Grounds, and Reasons, which makes this service to be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Moral Law, and therefore in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment also. And the Duty is enjoyned in that <hi>Psalm,</hi> upon many more moral reasons therein expressed. And there are two other <hi>Psalms</hi> where are nothing but commands to perform this Office of Prais, and Reasons to inforce it: the one is the 147. and the other the 98.<note place="margin">Psalm 98. &amp; 147.</note> but herein, I will only name two Gospel Arguments, whereupon he commands this duty. The former is in <hi>Psal.</hi> 149.<note place="margin">Psal. 149.</note> wherein having given the charge, in the three first verses, he ends thus, <hi>Sing Praises unto him with the Timbrell and Harp:</hi> All which he first backs with this Reason, in the fourth verse, <hi>For the Lord taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in his peopl, he will beautifie the meek with salvation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 4.</note> Which our Saviour sums up in the third Beatitude, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.5.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.5.</note>
                  <hi>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</hi> So that if Blessedness, and Inheritance of the Earth, be Gospel Promises, than Glorifying, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfying God <hi>with instrumental Musick,</hi> is also a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Duty.</p>
               <p>The other is in <hi>Psal.</hi> 98.<note place="margin">Psal. 98.9.</note> wherein the <hi>Psalmist</hi> having been something large, in injunction of this Duty, he concludes it, and the <hi>Psalm</hi> upon this Reason: <hi>For he cometh to Judg the earth: with righteousness shall he Judg
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:205014:22"/> the world, and the peopl with equity, v.</hi> 9. So then if Christs return to Judgement be an Articl of our Faith, we are enjoyned the same in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And herein it is to be noted, that all Commands given in the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> (not exacting Obedience, to som Ceremonial or Judicial Law, neither subordinate unto the Moral Law, nor received into som National-Law:) are obliging to Christians, as is evident by comparing <hi>Psal.</hi> 117.1. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. and <hi>Psalm</hi> 95. according to the Septuagint, from the 7. <hi>v</hi> unto the end, with <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7-11.<note place="margin">Psal. 117.1. <hi>with</hi> Rom. 11.15.

                  <q>He hath the Key of <hi>David,</hi> because <hi>David</hi> himself by these seals with a certain force, concerning him <hi>(that is our Saviour)</hi> in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> prophesieth, and delivereth the things concerning his Incarnation, and Passion, and Death, and Resurrection, and Glory, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:205014:22"/> Kingdom, and Judgement, opening that which no man shutteth, and shutting that which no man open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</q> Thus far Saint <hi>Hilary.</hi> This Key the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> is not more peremptory in commanding, more full in describing, nor more frequent in repeating any thing tending to the Glory, and the Government of the Kingdom of Christ, and his Service, than in charging, commanding, and prescribing this <hi>duty of serving God with Instrumental Musick.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> For solution hereof take these four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This Objection stands upon two legs, <hi>first Scripture, that we must pray with the Spirit,</hi> that is, with minde and affection, which is ownd, and acknowledged by all; for every school-boy understands this, that <hi>Orantis est nil nisi caelestia cogitare.</hi>
                  <q>A man in his prayers must minde nothing but heavenly things;</q> but here lies the Objection, <hi>I will pray with understanding also,</hi> as if Instrumental <hi>Musick</hi> were an hinderance thereunto; in the answer whereof I might be very large, but affecting brevity, take what a profest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former says in this case, thus; "There are no songs or verses sung by the Quire, <hi>(the reason is the same for the Organ,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The other leg, whereupon this <hi>Objection</hi> stands, is the authority of <hi>Justin Martyr:</hi>

Hujusmodi enim Musica Instrumenta magis animum movent ad Delectationem, quàm ut per ea formetur interius bona Dispositio. In veteri autem Testamento, usus erat talium instrumentorum, tum quia populus erat magis durus, &amp; carnalis: unde erat per hujusmodi instrumenta provocandus sicut &amp; per promissiones terrenas: tum etiam quia hujusmodi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumenta corporalia aliquid figurabant. <q>As saith the Philosopher in the <hi>8.</hi> book of <hi>Polit.</hi> Neither are Pipes to be brought unto Discipline, nor any other artificial Instrument of <hi>Musick,</hi> namely Harps, and if there be any other such thing: but what things soever make the Auditors good. For of this sort are Musical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for they rather move the minde unto delight, then thereby make a good disposition. But in the Old Testament there was an use of such instruments, and also because that people were more hard, and carnal, whence they were to be provoked by these kind of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and as it were by earthly promises: and also because these kind of Corporal Instruments figured out some thing.</q>

                  <q>He doth not clearly deny that Musical Instruments were used in his time, neither doth he altogether reprove this use; and now after it was established, and approved, so that there be a mean in the tunes, it ought not to be reprehended; neither may we be said to Judaize in performance of a clear peremptory command, enjoyned both in the Old and the New Testament.</q>

               <p n="3">3. That such Musick moves mens mindes rather to delight than to a bettering thereof, is to be understood of unlawful prophane Musick, and not lawful whether prophane or sacred.</p>

                  <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> in blaming them then at <hi>Oxford,</hi> for being in <hi>lov with those specious, pompous, loud exteriour complements;</hi> wherein by the last word <hi>complements,</hi> he concludes them all <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> as performing the same without <hi>hearty sincerity and devotion:</hi> Without which, Praying, Preaching, receiving the Sacraments, singing of <hi>Psalms</hi> by voice, and every holy Service, are but <hi>exteriour complements:</hi> than all which, one singl groan in the Spirit, is more worth: they <hi>all being meer out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward duties, and specious, loud, outward dssimulations:</hi> but where true zeal of heart goes along, whether it be <hi>Reading, Praying, Preaching, receiving the Sacrament, singing with Voice, or Instrument, it is acceptabl to God;</hi> otherwise it is not. And herein he shows the badg of all infectious judgements, which is <hi>want of charity,</hi> by taking Gods office out of his hand, in judging other mens hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </note>2<seg rend="sup">o</seg> In the second place, be would seem to be offended with them, for <hi>Presumption,</hi> in attempting to <hi>catch God Almighty by a fine air,</hi> made by <hi>multiplicity of Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Instruments,</hi> wherein there is, as in the former, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous <hi>petitio principii;</hi> for no man of any Principls in Religion, can be so weak and silly, to believ that God may be gained by any meer outward performance what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.

                  </note> Where Musick both Vocal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental is injoyned to be so performed, as all may understand it; but this is the quality of most of those that have a prejudicacy against any thing or person, to deny knowledg, or understanding thereof, and profit thereby.</p>
               <p>Lastly, he highly pleads against <hi>Instrumental Musick by Authority,</hi> in the words of <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> in the very end of the 17. <hi>chap.</hi> of his Book <hi>de incertitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, &amp; vanitate scientiarum:</hi> which are given in the Objection <hi>verbatim,</hi> in both Latin, and English, as by Sir. <hi>E.D.</hi> delivered, whereunto <hi>Agrippa</hi> himself by the Addition of <hi>quando, <hi>when,</hi>
                  </hi> givs a sufficient answer thus; <hi>Sed</hi> quando <hi>auribus, pariter &amp; animo judicii sub trahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur authoritas;</hi>
                  <q>But when the power of Judgement is taken away from the ears, and from the mind:</q> then do we grant there is <hi>chanting it with belluine noises,</hi> &amp;c. But where the heart is accompanied with knowledg, understanding, and zeal, <hi>Instrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> will inflame and rais up a Devotion, acceptabl to God.</p>
               <p>Again, consider but either the Book, whence this <hi>ribbl rabbl</hi> (rather than Argument) was taken, or the <hi>Author</hi> thereof, and it will appear an Objection not worth notice; for in som copies it is stiled <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio Invectiva,</hi> "An Invectiv Declamation" against all Arts and Sciences; and Invections, (whereof this is one of the largest size) are not Arguments. And of that Book, the Author himself in his Epistle Dedicatory
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:205014:31"/> saith thus: <hi>Opus quale hactenus nostra non viderit aetas, sed non nisi famoso cuiquam, Orbis vastatori profuturum.</hi>
                  <q>Such a work as hath not seen the world to this time; but to benefit none, but to every one that would be a Destroyer of the world.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Is this then a fit Book, out of which any one may lawfully urge an Argument? The <hi>Author,</hi> let us look upon as the Pen-man of this Book; and in his Personal qualifications; and we shall find he is not of authority for an Argument: As he is Pen-man thereof, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Epistl he saith of himself,<note place="margin">Cornel.

               <p>Thus is Sir <hi>Edward Derings Objection</hi> sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felled, wherein he himself towards the latter end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of begins to relent, in the foresaid <hi>Preface</hi> before his discours of Proper sacrifice, and to acknowledg that though there <hi>may be Arguments for it in the Hymnal part, that yet for ought he ever heard, there can be none for the Precatory part; becaus, saith he, no man can make his solemn Prayers in a Tune, but that he must make them unlike Prayers.</hi> Whereunto I answer, Prayers are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Petitions</hi> unto God, and therefore Petitions are Prayers, whether they be in <hi>prose</hi> or in <hi>vers,</hi> whether delivered <hi>by reading, singing, or playing upon Musical Instruments,</hi> provided that true faith, warm zeal, and sincere devotion giv life thereunto. Otherwise we must conclude, that those many <hi>Requests</hi> in the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> are not like <hi>Prayers,</hi> becaus they were by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> compiled in vers, and played on <hi>Musical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> and should any man conclude our <hi>Reading Book of Psalms,</hi> to comprehend and contain <hi>Prayers</hi> in it, and not the <hi>Singing Book of Psalms,</hi> we should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>account it for <hi>strange Logick.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Grant they do, it will not thence follow that this Service is either unwarrantabl, or unlawful; so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny go to Church only to see the Preacher; will it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, they must no longer hear Sermons? So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny go to Church for fashion, and for company, or for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:205014:32"/> custom; must they therefore be forbid going to Church? That men go to the hous of God upon any account, let us therein rejoyce. For som go to Church with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to intangl, catch, or find fault with the Preacher, yet somtimes it pleaseth God, that they are at one time or another caught themselves. Thus Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> went on purpose to insnare Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> and returned a Convert. As <hi>Pighius</hi> read <hi>Calvins Institutions</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to confute them, when it was Gods will, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he should return rectified in his judgement, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrin of Justification. Father <hi>Latimer</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that som went to Church only to take a nap, and he had rather they should com thither on purpose to nap, than not go at all. So perhaps, som may go to Church, to hear the melody that is in Church-Musick: but who knows, but it may pleas the fadomless, and unsearchabl wisdom of God, the only Teacher, to lead them such a way, that by hearing those things wherein their ears delight, their hearts may be caught, and that they may learn feelingly, and affectionately to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand those things, whereby they may be eternally sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved! <hi>Amen.</hi>
